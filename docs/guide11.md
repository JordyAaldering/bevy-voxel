# Performance debugging

At this point, I would like to see some performance statistics.
What is my framerate? How many chunks are currently loaded? What is my memory usage? etc.
However, I don't want to put all of this in the game view.

I find this very hard to read.
Rather, some plots and interactivity would be much nicer.

What we can do is to a browser-based debug dashboard.
- Bevy exposes selected metrics and debug settings to a WebSocket.
- A browser dashboard displays live graphs, counters, etc.

https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/blob/main/examples/websockets/src/main.rs
https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/extract/ws/

```bash
cargo add axum --features ws
cargo add tokio --features rt-multi-thread,macros,net,sync,time
cargo add serde --features derive
cargo add serde_json
```

- `axum` is a web framework for Rust, which we can use to serve a dashboard.
- `tokio` is an async runtime for Rust, which we need to run the web server outside the Bevy game loop. Otherwise, the web server would block the game loop.
- `serde` and `serde_json` are used to serialize the metrics data to JSON, which can be easily consumed by the browser dashboard.

You can really take this quite far, and implement a full-featured dashboard with multiple pages, graphs, etc.
I'm no web developer, so I'll keep it simple, but feel free to add more features to the dashboard at this point!

You could even go a step further and make the game configurable from the dashboard, for example for showing gizmos.
However, I prefer to keep the dashboard read-only, and instead use the Bevy `bevy-inspector-egui` plugin for that.

## Feature gate

If you ever share your game, you probably don't want to ship the debug dashboard with it.
We can gate the debug dashboard, and the necessary dependencies, behind a feature flag.

https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html

I omit it for now, because I want to avoid recompilations when enabling/disabling certain flags.
